title: "Evolution of a Mindfulness Based Stress Relief Program for the Community College Campus"
description: "Although not mainstream in academic settings, recent studies have indicated the value of mindfulness activities on student performance, behavior, and resilience (e.g. Lin and Mai, 2018; Vidic and Cherup, 2019). We recognized the need for mindfulness practices among our stressed community college students who are routinely tasked with juggling academic obligations and personal barriers. Providing snacks and space simply was not enough support. To address this need, we expanded upon an inherited stress relief program delivered to students twice each semester. We built in a foundation of mindfulness activities, including meditation and therapy dog sessions. We continue to add experimental passive and active mindfulness options designed to capture the attention of a very diverse body of students. The result is a work in progress, but one that has enabled us to form lasting connections and initiate greater opportunities for the library to provide mindfulness services across campus. Utilizing a poster presentation format, we wish to demonstrate to conference attendees a method and examples by which to establish an intentional mindfulness-based stress relief program. We will emphasize leveraging of existing resources, including mindfulness skills, interests, and campus relationships of academic library staff."

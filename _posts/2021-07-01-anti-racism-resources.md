title: 'Connecting Across Campus by Amplifying Anti-Racism Resources'
description: 'In summer 2020, The Ohio State University Libraries was asked to partner in collaboration with The Ohio State University Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to provide expanded access to anti-racism book content in support of continuing education, reading groups, and professional development across the university. The Libraries’ African American and African Studies Librarian worked with ODI’s Director for Strategic Diversity Planning, Training, and Assessment to identify anti-racism book titles of interest that were recommended for purchase or expanded access to the Collections Strategist. Topical research guides were created to supplement the reading lists, and new collections practices were developed and implemented to support campus-wide anti-racism educational opportunities. This poster will detail not only the process of collaboration with another unit within the university, but outline challenges faced with budget management, publishing and vendor practices with anti-racism resources, and COVID-19 implications. We will address critical approaches to anti-racism within library collaborations to university campus communities including outreach, teaching, and collections as part of the evolving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) movement.'

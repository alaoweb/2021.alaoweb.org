title: "Making the Most of a Scarce Resource: Leveraging LibCal to Circulate Adobe Software Licenses"
description: "Adobe (Photoshop, Illustrator, Creative Cloud, etc.) licenses are expensive and many institutions have to ration access to them. But many users are eager for access to their powerful software, and often need access only for a short time. Using open-source software that we will share with you, we use the Adobe User Management API to turn Adobe licenses on and off for users who reserve access to the software using LibCal’s “Equipment Checkout” feature. If a license is available (not checked out), users can get short-term access to the software almost instantaneously and without direct intervention by library staff. This lets us maintain an affordable number of licenses and legally and efficiently share them among students, faculty, and staff. This open source solution can also be used with other licenses that can be managed by an API."

title: 'Transforming Research and Course Guides for Social Work'
description: 'The COVID-19 pandemic has led library professionals to work in close collaboration and be more creative and innovative in digitally delivering their resources and services. This session discusses the pilot project between two library departments to transform research and course guides for Social Work. Although librarians spend considerable efforts creating these guides, students often have problems navigating, locating, and using them. The presenters will share the factors attributing to the low and limited use of these guides, such as the overwhelming number of hidden guides, overloaded resources without a learning context, partial duplication and similarity among siloed guides. The presenters will also describe transforming the Social Work research and course guide into a one-stop-shop with a creative approach. By the end of this session, attendees will learn how to pull various resources, embed interactive service points, integrate the guides via multiple venues, and facilitate increased faculty collaboration to better meet students at the point of their needs.'

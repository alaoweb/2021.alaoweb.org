title: 'A Celebration of Us!:  A Telling of a Libraries’ Value During COVID-19 Through Stories and Data'
description: "The university libraries accomplished many new and innovative services and projects through the pandemic with an extremely limited staff and decreasing budgets.  Think about what the libraries could do if more investments were made to advance our excellent services, resources, and personnel. \n\nThis past year and a half have been like no other, and the large, urban library went above and beyond to serve the its community during this time.  A library COVID Data Group was charged to gather data regarding services that demonstrated its value to the university’s mission.\n\nThe timeframe for the data was March 13, 2020 to April 2021.  The Group emailed key staff to gather quantitative data and sent out a survey to all staff to collect qualitative data.  The Group analyzed that data and wrote a report.  The report included data and stories that celebrated all of the new services and hard work that the staff performed over the time of the pandemic. in the areas of student/faculty success, teaching/learning, innovative solutions, online collections, and scholarly content. The findings proved to be an excellent marketing tool and benefitted the library by enabling the Deans and librarians to engage high-level audiences in meaningful conversations. \n"

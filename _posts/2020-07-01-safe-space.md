title: "Where do we belong? Student thoughts about the Library as a Safe Space"
description: "Looking for ways to understand and better serve the changing demographic of your student body? This poster session will share focus group results from students of minority communities asking what factors define a Safe Space. A greater understanding of these factors will assist libraries in working toward the goal of inclusivity and openness, a common mission among many college and university libraries. Data presented will include graphics, models, and suggestions for how libraries could use these results to adapt spaces and services. See the visualized responses and learn to conduct a similar study at your library. Main takeaways include positive and negative interactions in library spaces, ideas for new services and/or spaces, and library services reported to be the most important to our students."

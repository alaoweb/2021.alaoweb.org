title: 'Charting our course, Measuring our progress: Creating a Data Dashboard for Library Services'
description: 'Libraries and their administrations seek to demonstrate a return on investment made by our colleges or universities in our services and resources. Developing a dashboard which tracks and displays usage can be a helpful tool to assist with this task. This poster session will provide an overview of one attempt to develop a dashboard for circulation, document delivery, and information transactions. These experiences included: synthesizing data from multiple software / online services, each with its own idiosyncratic, and often inconsistent, interface; selecting tools for creating charts and graphs; selecting data to be charted over time and/or displayed in a summary view. The session is intended to benefit both those who work directly with data or from administrators who use data in decision-making. Take-homes may include: discussion of one model currently in use to develop models for an approach, we well as possible improvements; and an ability to evaluate pro’s and con’s of widely available services for manipulating and displaying data in order to select the most effective approaches.'

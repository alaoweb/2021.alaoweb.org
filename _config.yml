frameworks, development, outcomes, and emerging countermeasures of low morale, which is defined
as repeated and protracted exposure to workplace abuse and neglect (Kendrick, 2017). Learning more
about these concerns can help promote authentic civility and collegiality in North American libraries and
reduce the factors that can cause employee mistreatment and misconduct in library workplaces.",

With recent events highlighting specific issues around race, the conversation has now shifted to many people wanting to be anti-racist. In this session, we will focus on anti-racism as action, rather than using the word anti-racist as identity. In particular, we will examine our notions of professionalism in libraries. Can changing how we define professionalism in library workplaces be an example of anti-racist action? We will take a critical look at how certain hallmarks of white supremacist culture inform our notions of professionalism and acceptable workplace culture. These commonly accepted traits can actually contribute to low morale, the prevalence of microaggressions, retention issues, etc. Together, we will explore ways to transform our workplace cultures by looking at specific actions that resist these hallmarks in order to create equitable workplaces.",

However, instead of collecting clothes at the conference, we ask that you consider making a donation to this worthy organization. There are three affiliates of Dress for Success in Ohio, and you can choose the region that you would like to support.  If you decide to make a donation, please put ALAO member in the notes field.'

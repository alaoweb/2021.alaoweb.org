                conference virtual and amazing, and as the recipient of the Special 
                Presidential Commendation in 2020. The recipientâ€™s nominator said the 
                following about him: 

                <blockquote>'He promotes the most creative thinking and curiosity within librarianship, 
                information and communities. He leads with important questions, but then 
                collaborates with others to see the group's answers and ideas come to 
                fruition - this is evident in his role as TEDSIG co-chair and through his 
                many years of leadership on the webmaster's team and conference planning 
                committees. He has dedicated a lot of time ensuring ALAO looks good online 
                and that our programs and people are promoted within the state and beyond. 
                He took on a leadership role every time as a webmaster and refreshed ALAO 
                programming as TEDSIG co-chair.</blockquote>'

One of the colleagues that he has mentored said, <blockquote>Being a new librarian, I had many questions, and Mark was there from the beginning to coach me through thorny faculty and student interactions. He provided an array of strategies from collection development to instruction techniques, all while encouraging me to find my own path and develop my own relationships and abilities. I heartily recommend Mark for the Kathryn L. Venditti Mentoring Award as he truly brings out the best in those surrounding him.</blockquote></p> 

                <p>In addition to serving as a mentor for ALAO's own mentoring program, he has mentored 10-15 undergraduate students from Notre Dame College for summer internships over the past 10 or so years. He also frequently works with graduate LIS students completing their practicum. A Kent State library science student that the recipient recently supervised said, <blockquote>Mark was incredibly welcoming; he sat down with me to talk through my goals and lay out a specific plan. He introduced me to everyone at [the library
                ]
                and helped to walk me through the ins and outs of information literacy instruction. His guidance definitely helped me to develop the skills and confidence I needed to become a professional and to secure my first job in an academic library.</blockquote></p>
                
                <p>Finally, the nominator, attests: <blockquote>To see that he has volunteered to work with so many students demonstrates his ongoing commitment to service and mentoring the next generation of professionals. It is clear to me through his actions and his own words that Mark
                genuinely enjoys developing and supporting new librarians. I hope the committee will find him to be worthy of the honor of the Kathryn Venditti Mentoring Award.</blockquote></p>
